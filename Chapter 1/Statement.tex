\section{Statement of the Study}

Waste management plays a crucial role in environmental sustainability, it involves the collection, processing, recycling, and disposal of waste materials. A key factor that makes the waste management process more effective is waste segregation. The increasing volume of improperly segregated waste has a significant impact to pollution, health, and environmental damage. By utilizing technology and modernization, the problem of improper waste segregation can be solve.

The traditional approach of waste segregation involves manual sorting that depends on peopleâ€™s knowledge that often leads to error, inefficiency, and unreliability. This study addresses the problem for the lack of a reliable and efficient waste segregation tool that assists users in segregating waste more accurately. Specifically, this study aims to development a mobile application that utilizes image recognition and machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and sort waste into their proper categories.

By offering a user-friendly and accessible method for waste segregation, the mobile application aims to contribute to improved waste management practices, enhancing environmental sustainability and educating the users as well on proper waste disposal methods.
