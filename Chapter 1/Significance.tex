\section{Significance of the Study}

The proposed system holds significant potential by addressing environmental challenges through technological innovation. By developing a system capable of accurately categorizing waste as biodegradable, non-biodegradable, or recyclable, the study aims to enhance waste sorting practices and contribute to effective waste segregation. The following sections detail the benefits of the system:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Contribution to Knowledge:} The system’s use of artificial intelligence represents a valuable advancement in the technological sector, particularly in environmental science. By offering an innovative approach to waste classification, it will fill gaps in current waste management practices and contribute to the body of knowledge on AI applications in environmental sustainability.
	
	\item \textbf{Practical Implications:} The system’s features can assist users in more accurately classifying waste, potentially leading to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Improved waste segregation, which enhances waste collection, disposal, recycling, and composting practices.
		\item Increased environmental awareness and better segregation practices within households.
		\item Integration into educational institutions for teaching proper waste management, thereby enhancing student engagement.
		\item Benefits to government authorities and waste management professionals by improving waste sorting, recycling programs, and overall waste management systems.
		\item Utilization by environmentalists for awareness campaigns and promoting environmental responsibility.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item \textbf{Theoretical Implications:} The development of this system may contribute to new theories or models in AI-enhanced waste management and human-computer interaction. It can provide insights into how technology influences human behavior and supports the evolution of personal-level waste management systems.
	
	\item \textbf{Policy Implications:} The successful implementation of this application could prompt local governments to revise waste collection policies, incorporating pre-collection waste separation. Such changes could include rewarding compliant households and imposing penalties on those that do not adhere to waste segregation guidelines.
	
	\item \textbf{Social and Economic Impact:} The system has the potential to alter individual behaviors regarding waste management, increase environmental awareness, and inspire communities to adopt cleaner environmental policies. Economically, it could lead to increased recycling rates, reduced landfill waste, and the production of natural composts beneficial for agricultural use.
	
	\item \textbf{Future Research Directions:} The system could pave the way for future research into advanced technological solutions for environmental sustainability. Future developments may include features for classifying additional types of waste and integrating more sophisticated models into broader waste management systems.
