\section{Scope and Delimitation}
	The research aims to develop and evaluate a mobile application designed to assist users in waste segregation by recognizing and categorizing waste as recyclable, biodegradable, or non-biodegradable. The app will utilize image recognition technology alongside a comprehensive database of waste items to ensure accurate classification. Additionally, the study will assess the effectiveness of the user interface in guiding users, enhancing environmental awareness through educational content.
	
	The scope of this study is limited to the Philippines or to other aspects of waste segregation. The research will not address other facets of environmental sustainability outside of waste management. Limitations of the study include the potential for misclassification due to the inherent challenges of image recognition technology. Furthermore, the app's effectiveness may be constrained by the initial comprehensiveness of its database, which may not cover all waste items users might encounter.
