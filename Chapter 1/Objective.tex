\section{Objective of the Study}

\subsection{General Objective}
The primary purpose of this Study is to develop a mobile application that will assist users in accurately classifies waste materials into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, and recyclable using an image recognition technology.

\subsection{Specific Objective}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To develop an image recognition model, utilizing Google's AI training platform to accurately classifies waste items into biodegradable, non-biodegradable, or recyclable classes by training the model with uploaded images of various waste materials.
	
	\item To design a user-friendly mobile application interface using Android Studio, which will simplifies the process of identifying and categorizing of waste items.
	
	\item To evaluate the performance and accuracy of the trained model under various real-world conditions such as lightning and background interference.
	
	\item To assess the app's impact on users' environmental awareness and waste segregation behavior through feedback and usability testing.
	
	\item To provide a foundational study that can serve as a guide or inspiration for future developers working on related projects, such as automated waste sorting machines or other waste management innovations.
